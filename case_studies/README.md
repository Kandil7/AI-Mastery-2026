## Contributing New Case Studies

When adding new case studies, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use the same format as existing case studies
2. Include quantitative metrics and business impact
3. Provide real implementation code examples
4. Number your case study appropriately (next available number)
5. Add it to this index
6. Include relevant diagrams or architecture drawings where helpful

Case studies should represent realistic scenarios with practical implementations that demonstrate the concepts taught in the AI-Mastery-2026 curriculum.
