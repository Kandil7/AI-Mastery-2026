# AI/ML Case Studies

This directory contains comprehensive case studies of real-world AI and Machine Learning implementations, focusing on production-grade systems, architectural decisions, and lessons learned.

## Purpose

These case studies are designed for senior AI/ML engineers who want to understand how to design, implement, and operate sophisticated AI systems in production environments. Each case study includes:

- Executive summaries of the implementation
- Business problem definitions and requirements
- Detailed architecture overviews
- Technical implementation details
- Performance metrics and benchmarks
- Production challenges and solutions
- Lessons learned and key takeaways

## Available Case Studies

1. **Production RAG System** - Comprehensive implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system at scale (10M+ documents)
2. **Vector Database Scaling** - Production-grade scaling of vector database for AI search platform (1.2B+ vectors, 12,500 QPS)
3. **Feature Store Production** - Enterprise-grade feature store implementation for financial services (4.2B features/day, 8.2ms p95 latency)
4. **Multi-Modal Search System** - Production implementation of unified search across text, image, audio, and video (8.4B queries/month, 142ms p50 latency, 0.78 NDCG@10)

Each case study follows a standardized format to ensure consistency and ease of comparison across different AI/ML applications.
