- Know horizontal scaling patterns

### Behavioral ✅
- **4 STAR stories** ready:
  1. Technical challenge (fraud model 60%→89% precision)

## 🚀 What Makes This Portfolio Elite

### 1. **White-Box Approach**
> "I don't just use libraries — I build them. BERT isn't magic when you've implemented scaled dot-product attention yourself."

### 2. **Production Experience**
> "My capstone isn't a Jupyter notebook. It's a FastAPI service with Docker, tests, monitoring, and <10ms p95 latency."

### 3. **System Thinking**
> "I can design RAG at 1M docs just as easily as I can implement LSTM cells. I understand the full stack."

### 4. **Proven Problem Solving**
> "In my STAR stories, I show real impact: $2M saved, 35% ticket reduction, 3 production incidents prevented."
