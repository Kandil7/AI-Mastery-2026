# 🚀 Q1 2026: The "Senior Engineer" Sprint

**Goal**: Land a Senior Full Stack AI/ML Role by April 1st, 2026.

## ⚡ Velocity Rules (Meta-Friction Cutting)
1.  **"Fast Enough" Target**: Each week = **1 Notebook** (Concept) + **1 Artifact** (Merged Code/Feature).
2.  **WIP Limit**: Max **2 active topics** at any time. Everything else goes to [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](docs/BACKLOG.md).
3.  **Definition of Done**:
    *   [ ] Explained in own words (short note in `docs/` or `LEARNING_LOG.md`)
    *   [ ] Coded from scratch (or verified in `src/`)
    *   [ ] Used in a pipeline (App or Demo Notebook)
4.  **Code First**: Study `src/` implementation & tests *before* reading external articles.
5.  **Feedback Loop**: Write a Weekly Entry in [`docs/LEARNING_LOG.md`](docs/LEARNING_LOG.md).
