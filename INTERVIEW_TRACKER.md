## 📊 Technical Depth Checklist

### ML Fundamentals
- [ ] Bias-variance trade-off (can explain with examples)
- [ ] Regularization: L1 vs L2 (when to use each)
- [ ] Gradient descent variants (SGD, Adam, RMSprop)
- [ ] Cross-validation strategies
- [ ] Metrics: precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC

### Deep Learning
- [ ] Backpropagation (can derive for 2-layer net)
- [ ] Activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, softmax derivatives)
- [ ] Batch normalization (why it helps, where to place)
- [ ] Dropout (why it works, training vs inference)
- [ ] CNN architecture (convolution, pooling, receptive field)
- [ ] LSTM/GRU gates (can explain each gate's purpose)

### Transformers & LLMs
- [ ] Self-attention mechanism (can implement from scratch)
- [ ] Multi-head attention (why multiple heads?)
- [ ] Positional encodings (sinusoidal vs learned)
- [ ] Tokenization strategies (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece)
- [ ] Fine-tuning: LoRA, QLoRA, full fine-tune trade-offs
- [ ] Prompt engineering best practices

### RAG & Retrieval
- [ ] Chunking strategies (semantic, sliding window, hierarchical)
- [ ] Embedding models (when to use which)
- [ ] Vector databases (HNSW, LSH, trade-offs)
- [ ] Hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse)
- [ ] Reranking (cross-encoder vs bi-encoder)
- [ ] RAG evaluation metrics (faithfulness, relevance)
