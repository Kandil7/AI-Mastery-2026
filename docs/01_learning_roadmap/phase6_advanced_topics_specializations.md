# Phase 6: Advanced Topics & Specializations

**Objective:** Explore cutting-edge and specialized areas of AI engineering.

## Key Topics:

*   **Edge AI:** Explore the challenges and techniques for deploying AI models on resource-constrained edge devices, including model quantization, pruning, and efficient inference strategies for real-time applications.
*   **Multimodal AI:** Delve into AI systems that process and understand information from multiple modalities, such as combining text, images, and audio within advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.
*   **Bio-inspired AI:** Investigate AI paradigms inspired by biological systems, including neuromorphic computing (mimicking brain structures), swarm intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms for optimization and problem-solving.
*   **Quantum AI/Blockchain AI:** Gain a conceptual understanding of emerging fields like Quantum AI (leveraging quantum mechanics for computation) and Blockchain AI (decentralized AI applications), and their potential transformative applications.

## Deliverables:

*   Exploration and analysis of various case studies related to advanced topics, available in [`docs/06_case_studies/`](../06_case_studies/README.md). This includes specific examples like [`edge_ai_rag_systems.md`](../06_case_studies/rag_systems/edge_ai_rag_systems.md) and [`multimodal_rag_systems.md`](../06_case_studies/rag_systems/multimodal_rag_systems.md).
*   In-depth understanding gained by reviewing specialized documentation and deep dives into relevant topics within [`docs/02_core_concepts/deep_dives/`](../02_core_concepts/deep_dives/README.md), focusing on the chosen areas of specialization.
