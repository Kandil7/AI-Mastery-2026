# Phase 4: Advanced LLM Engineering & Fine-tuning

**Objective:** Master techniques for adapting and optimizing LLMs for specific tasks.

## Key Topics:

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Advanced techniques, few-shot learning, chain-of-thought.
*   **Fine-tuning:** LoRA, QLoRA, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
*   **LLM Evaluation:** RAG evaluation metrics (faithfulness, relevance), LLM-as-a-judge.
*   **Agentic Frameworks:** Basic agent architectures, multi-agent systems.

## Deliverables:

*   Fine-tuning adapters in [`src/llm/`](../../src/llm/).
*   Notebooks demonstrating fine-tuning and advanced prompting in [`research/`](../../research/).
*   Documentation in [`docs/02_core_concepts/deep_dives/`](../02_core_concepts/deep_dives/README.md) (e.g., prompt engineering, fine-tuning).
*   Completion of [`docs/04_tutorials/exercises/level4_reranking.md`](../04_tutorials/exercises/level4_reranking.md), [`docs/04_tutorials/exercises/level5_evaluation.md`](../04_tutorials/exercises/level5_evaluation.md).
