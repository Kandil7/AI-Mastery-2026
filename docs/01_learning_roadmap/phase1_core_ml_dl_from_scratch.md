# Phase 1: Core ML/DL Algorithms from Scratch

**Objective:** Deeply understand machine learning and deep learning algorithms by implementing them from first principles.

## Key Topics:

*   **Classical ML:** Implement and understand foundational algorithms like Linear Regression (predicting continuous values), Logistic Regression (binary classification), Decision Trees (tree-based decisions), Support Vector Machines (SVMs for classification and regression), and K-Means (unsupervised clustering). Focus on the underlying math and step-by-step implementation.
*   **Neural Networks:** Build basic neural network components from scratch, starting with Perceptrons, then advancing to Multi-Layer Perceptrons. Understand the role and implementation of various activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid, ReLU) and the core concept of backpropagation for training.
*   **Optimization:** Explore and implement optimization algorithms such as Gradient Descent (including Stochastic Gradient Descent - SGD, and adaptive optimizers like Adam) to minimize loss functions. Understand regularization techniques (L1, L2) to prevent overfitting.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Learn to use and implement essential metrics for evaluating model performance: Precision, Recall, F1-score (for classification), and ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve).

## Deliverables:

*   From-scratch Python implementations of key algorithms in [`src/core/`](../../src/core/) (e.g., mathematical utilities) and [`src/ml/`](../../src/ml/) (e.g., `linear_regression.py`, `logistic_regression.py`).
*   Associated explanatory Jupyter notebooks completed in [`notebooks/02_classical_ml/`](../../notebooks/02_classical_ml/), focusing on one notebook per algorithm implemented.
*   Detailed documentation and theoretical understanding demonstrated through reviewing [`docs/02_core_concepts/fundamentals/ML_STUDY_GUIDE.md`](../02_core_concepts/fundamentals/ML_STUDY_GUIDE.md).
*   Completion of practical exercises, such as those found in [`docs/04_tutorials/exercises/level1_embeddings.md`](../04_tutorials/exercises/level1_embeddings.md), or adapting them to reinforce the from-scratch implementations.
