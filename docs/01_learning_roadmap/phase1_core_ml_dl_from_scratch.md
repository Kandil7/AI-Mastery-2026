# Phase 1: Core ML/DL Algorithms from Scratch

**Objective:** Deeply understand machine learning and deep learning algorithms by implementing them from first principles.

## Key Topics:

*   **Classical ML:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, K-Means.
*   **Neural Networks:** Perceptrons, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, activation functions, backpropagation.
*   **Optimization:** Gradient Descent (SGD, Adam), regularization techniques.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

## Deliverables:

*   From-scratch implementations in [`src/core/`](../../src/core/) and [`src/ml/`](../../src/ml/).
*   Associated explanatory notebooks in [`notebooks/02_classical_ml/`](../../notebooks/02_classical_ml/).
*   Detailed documentation in [`docs/02_core_concepts/fundamentals/ML_STUDY_GUIDE.md`](../02_core_concepts/fundamentals/ML_STUDY_GUIDE.md).
*   Completion of [`docs/04_tutorials/exercises/level1_embeddings.md`](../04_tutorials/exercises/level1_embeddings.md) (adapting if necessary).
