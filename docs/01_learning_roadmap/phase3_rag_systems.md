# Phase 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

**Objective:** Understand and build RAG pipelines, integrating vector databases and advanced retrieval strategies.

## Key Topics:

*   **Embeddings:** Text embedding models, vector space.
*   **Vector Databases:** Introduction to ChromaDB/Qdrant, custom implementations ([`src/production/`](../../src/production/)).
*   **Retrieval Strategies:** Dense retrieval, hybrid search (RRF).
*   **RAG Pipeline Construction:** Document ingestion, chunking, indexing, querying.

## Deliverables:

*   RAG components in [`src/llm/`](../../src/llm/).
*   RAG-focused notebooks in [`research/rag_engine/`](../../research/rag_engine/) and relevant [`notebooks/`](../../notebooks/) subdirectories.
*   System design documentation ([`docs/03_system_design/solutions/01_rag_at_scale.md`](../03_system_design/solutions/01_rag_at_scale.md)).
*   Completion of [`docs/04_tutorials/exercises/level2_chunking.md`](../04_tutorials/exercises/level2_chunking.md), [`docs/04_tutorials/exercises/level3_hybrid_search.md`](../04_tutorials/exercises/level3_hybrid_search.md).
