# Phase 7: Capstone Project & Portfolio Building

**Objective:** Apply all learned concepts to build a comprehensive, production-ready AI engineering project.

## Key Topics:

*   **End-to-end Project Planning and Execution:** Learn to define project scope, plan milestones, manage resources, and execute an AI project from conception to completion, applying agile methodologies where appropriate.
*   **Integration of Various Components:** Master the integration of diverse AI system components, including data ingestion and preprocessing, model training pipelines, deployment strategies (e.g., FastAPI, Docker), and continuous monitoring for performance and drift.
*   **Documentation of the Capstone Project:** Develop comprehensive documentation for your capstone project, covering architectural design, technical implementation details, API usage, evaluation results, and user guides.
*   **Interview Preparation and Portfolio Development:** Refine your interview skills by preparing to discuss your capstone project in detail, creating compelling project summaries, and building a professional portfolio that showcases your AI engineering capabilities.

## Deliverables:

*   A fully functional, end-to-end capstone project demonstrating your AI engineering skills, ideally deployed and accessible.
*   Comprehensive project documentation, including architecture diagrams, API specifications, and a detailed project report.
*   Updated and refined interview preparation materials, including behavioral stories, technical explanations of your capstone project, and a polished portfolio, all aligned with [`docs/05_interview_prep/`](../05_interview_prep/README.md).
