# Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundational Readiness

**Objective:** Establish development environment, understand repository structure, and review essential mathematical foundations.

## Key Topics:

*   **Environment Setup:** Docker, Git/GitHub workflow, Python virtual environments, VS Code setup.
*   **Repository Navigation:** Understanding `src/`, `notebooks/`, `docs/` layout, `Makefile` commands.
*   **Math Refresher:** Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, operations), Calculus (gradients, derivatives), Probability & Statistics (distributions, hypothesis testing).

## Deliverables:

*   Working development environment.
*   Familiarity with project navigation and key tools.
*   Review of [`docs/02_core_concepts/fundamentals/math_notes.md`](../02_core_concepts/fundamentals/math_notes.md).
*   Completion of relevant [`notebooks/01_foundations/`](../../notebooks/01_foundations/) notebooks.
