# Phase 5: MLOps & Production Deployment

**Objective:** Implement robust MLOps practices and deploy AI models to production environments.

## Key Topics:

*   **Model Serving:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, Dockerization.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, structured logging.
*   **CI/CD for ML:** Automated testing, deployment pipelines.
*   **Scalability & Resilience:** Load balancing, auto-scaling, disaster recovery.
*   **Security:** API security, data privacy.

## Deliverables:

*   FastAPI application for model serving ([`app/main.py`](../../app/main.py)).
*   Deployment guides ([`docs/03_system_design/deployment/`](../03_system_design/deployment/README.md)).
*   MLOps best practices documentation ([`docs/03_system_design/development/`](../03_system_design/development/README.md)).
*   Relevant scripts in [`scripts/`](../../scripts/).
*   Benchmarks for performance optimization.
