# 🧊 Backlog (The Icebox)

> **Philosophy**: Aggressively strip non-essential depth. If a rabbit hole doesn't produce code in `src/`, a test, or an app feature within 1-2 days, PARK IT HERE.

## 📥 Unsorted Ideas
- [ ] ...

## 📚 Topics to "Box" (Black-Box allowed for now)
*Complex implementations to skip derivation for until later.*
- [ ] Advanced RAG Observability (Use Phoenix/Arize for now)
- [ ] Custom CUDA Kernels for Attention (Use PyTorch standard for now)

## ⏳ Later / Deep Dives
*Interesting theory/math that isn't critical for the immediate Q1 Goal.*
- [ ] Full derivation of Normalizing Flows (Week 10 is enough implementation)
- [ ] ...
