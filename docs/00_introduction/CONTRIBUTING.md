# Contributing to AI-Mastery-2026

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AI-Mastery-2026 project! This toolkit is designed to help engineers understand AI from mathematical foundations to production systems using the "white-box" approach. We welcome contributions that align with our project philosophy and contribute to its growth as a comprehensive AI Engineering Toolkit.

## Getting Started

To contribute, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine.
3.  **Set up your development environment** using the provided `Makefile`:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
    This command will create a Python virtual environment, install all dependencies, and set up pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. Refer to the [User Guide](./01_user_guide.md) for more details on environment setup.

## Project Philosophy: The "White-Box" Approach

This project firmly adheres to the "white-box" approach to AI engineering:

*   **Math First:** Prioritize understanding the underlying mathematical foundations and deriving equations before using abstractions.
*   **Code Second:** Implement algorithms from scratch using fundamental libraries like NumPy to solidify understanding.
*   **Libraries Third:** Leverage high-level libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers) only after grasping the underlying mechanisms.
*   **Production Always:** Integrate production-readiness considerations into every development stage, from design to deployment.

## Code Style & Quality

*   **Python 3.10+** compatible.
*   **Type hints** are required for all function signatures.
*   **Line length**: 100 characters.
*   **Formatting**: Use `black` (configured for 100 char line length) and `isort`. Ensure your code is formatted by running `make format`.
*   **Linting/Type Checks**: Ensure your code passes `flake8` and `mypy` checks by running `make lint`.

## Documentation Standards

Comprehensive and clear documentation is a cornerstone of this project.

*   **General Structure:** Refer to the main [Documentation README](../README.md) for the overall structure and navigation.
*   **Code Documentation:** Each function, class, and module should include:
    1.  A brief, concise description of its purpose.
    2.  Where applicable, the underlying mathematical definition (using Unicode symbols for clarity).
    3.  Clearly defined `Args` and `Returns` sections.
    4.  An illustrative example usage.
*   **Contribution Documentation:** If you add new features or modules, ensure they are documented within the relevant sections under the `docs/` directory, following the established structure (e.g., [docs/02_core_concepts/](../02_core_concepts/README.md) for new algorithms, [docs/04_tutorials/](../04_tutorials/README.md) for new examples).

## Testing Guidelines

*   **Framework**: `pytest` with `pytest-cov` for test coverage.
*   **Location**: Tests should reside in the `tests/` directory and mirror the structure of the `src/` modules (e.g., `tests/ml/test_model.py` for `src/ml/model.py`).
*   **Execution**: Run tests locally using `make test` or `make test-cov`.
*   **Coverage**: Aim to maintain high test coverage (refer to coverage reports generated by `make test-cov`).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

*   **Commit Messages**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standards. Examples: `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve bug`, `docs: update user guide`.
*   **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
    *   Clearly describe the changes, their motivation, and any impact.
    *   Update relevant documentation (e.g., `README.md` files, user guides) if the interface or functionality changes.
    *   If you're introducing a significant feature, consider adding a new entry to [docs/TODO.md](../../TODO.md) for follow-up documentation needs.
    *   Request a second reviewer before merging, if you have permissions. If not, request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Security & Configuration Tips

*   **Secrets**: Store sensitive information (API keys, credentials) exclusively in environment variables. Avoid hardcoding or committing them to the repository. Consult `config/` for examples of environment variable usage.
*   **Artifacts**: Avoid committing large model artifacts or generated data directly to the repository. Place such outputs under `models/` or temporary `results/` directories and ensure they are tracked in `.gitignore`.
