# 🎓 Educational Layer - AI Engineering Curriculum

Welcome to the educational layer of the AI-Mastery-2026 project! This curriculum transforms the repository from a simple starter template into a complete **AI Engineering Education Program**.

## 🗺️ Navigation

This educational layer consists of six interconnected components:

### 1. 🧩 [Learning Map](./learning-map.md)
Maps theoretical concepts to their corresponding code implementations, helping you understand where specific ideas are realized in the codebase.

### 2. 🚨 [Failure Modes](./failure-modes/)
Teaches through common failure scenarios, showing how problems manifest and how the system addresses them.

### 3. 🏗️ [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](./adr/)
Documents key architectural decisions with rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences.

### 4. 🧪 [Progressive Exercises](./exercises/)
Hands-on exercises that build from basic concepts to advanced implementations.

### 5. 📊 [Evaluation Notebooks](../../notebooks/)
Interactive notebooks that teach evaluation methodologies and trade-off analysis.

### 6. 🚶 [Code Walkthroughs](./code-walkthroughs/)
Guided tours through critical code pathways, explaining design decisions and implementation details.

## 🧠 Learning Path Suggestions

### Beginner Path
1. Start with the [Learning Map](./learning-map.md) to understand the codebase structure
2. Work through [Level 1 Exercises](./exercises/level1_embeddings.md) on embeddings
3. Explore the [Ask Hybrid Use Case Walkthrough](./code-walkthroughs/ask-hybrid-usecase.md)

### Intermediate Path
1. Study [ADR-001](./adr/001-postgres-fts-vs-elasticsearch.md) on architecture decisions
2. Complete [Level 3 Exercises](./exercises/level3_hybrid_search.md) on hybrid search
3. Run the [Evaluation Basics Notebook](../../notebooks/90_evaluation_basics.ipynb)

### Advanced Path
1. Analyze [failure modes](./failure-modes/) to understand system resilience
2. Complete all [exercises](./exercises/) for hands-on experience
3. Study all [code walkthroughs](./code-walkthroughs/) for deep implementation understanding

## 🎯 Educational Philosophy

This curriculum follows the principle of **"Learning Through Building"**:

- **Theory → Practice**: Each concept connects to concrete implementations
- **Failure-Driven**: Learn from common mistakes and how to fix them
- **Architectural Thinking**: Understand not just how but why systems are designed
- **Hands-On**: Progressive exercises build practical skills
- **Measurable**: Evaluation tools provide objective feedback

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Begin with the [Learning Map](./learning-map.md) to orient yourself in the codebase
2. Choose your path based on experience level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
3. Follow the suggested progression or jump to topics of interest
4. Use the [exercises](./exercises/) to reinforce learning with hands-on practice
5. Validate your understanding with the [evaluation notebooks](../../notebooks/)

## 📚 Continuous Learning

This educational layer is designed to evolve with the codebase. As new features are added, corresponding educational materials will be created to maintain the connection between theory and practice.

The goal is to transform this repository from a "template" into a complete **AI Engineering Curriculum** where every line of code serves as a teaching opportunity.
