# Deprecated Documentation

This directory contains older versions of documentation files that have been superseded by the current, organized documentation structure in the main `docs/` directory.

**Do not refer to these files for up-to-date information.**

Their content has either been integrated, refined, or replaced by newer, more granular documents within the project. These files are kept for historical reference only.
