## Key Documents:

*   ### [Database Fundamentals](./database_fundamentals.md)
    *   Covers ACID properties, transaction management, different database types (SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL, Time-series, Vector), indexing strategies, and query processing basics. Essential for understanding how databases work under the hood.

*   ### [Database Design](./database_design.md)
    *   Details Entity-Relationship modeling, schema design patterns (star, snowflake), normalization forms (1NF through BCNF), denormalization strategies, and domain-driven design patterns. Learn how to design efficient and scalable database schemas.

*   ### [Seeding Strategies](./01_seeding_strategies.md)
    *   Details on various strategies for seeding databases, important for development, testing, and initial data population.
