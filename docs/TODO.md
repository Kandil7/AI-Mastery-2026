# Documentation TODOs

This document tracks planned documentation improvements, expansions, and areas requiring further detail within the AI-Mastery-2026 project. It serves as a living backlog for documentation efforts.

---

## High Priority:

*   [ ] **Review and update internal links** across all `.md` files to ensure accuracy after the repository reorganization.
*   [ ] **Expand `docs/00_introduction/01_user_guide.md`** with more detailed setup instructions and navigation tips.
*   [ ] **Flesh out Phase-specific roadmap files** (`docs/01_learning_roadmap/phaseX_*.md`) with more granular content, relevant links, and recommended exercises.
*   [ ] **Review and re-categorize files in `docs/legacy_or_misc/`**. Prioritize translation for Arabic documents.

## Medium Priority:

*   [ ] **Create a comprehensive `docs/02_core_concepts/README.md`** that effectively summarizes all sub-sections.
*   [ ] **Add more content and examples** to `docs/04_tutorials/`.
*   [ ] **Integrate `notebooks/` into the learning roadmap** by adding direct links from phase documents to relevant notebooks.
*   [ ] **Develop more `case_studies/`** covering diverse AI applications.

## Low Priority:

*   [ ] **Add detailed API reference documentation** in `docs/reference/`.
*   [ ] **Create a glossary of AI/ML terms** in `docs/reference/`.
*   [ ] **Review and update all existing `README.md` files** in `src/`, `research/`, and other code directories to align with the new documentation standards and structure.

## Completed Tasks:

*   [x] Reorganize documentation into the new `docs/` structure.
*   [x] Create main `docs/README.md` as central navigation hub.
*   [x] Create `docs/01_learning_roadmap/README.md`.
*   [x] Create individual roadmap phase files (`phase0_*.md` to `phase7_*.md`).
*   [x] Consolidate project roadmap files into `docs/01_learning_roadmap/project_roadmaps_overview.md`.
*   [x] Update `docs/agents/AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/GEMINI.md`, `docs/agents/QWEN.md` to reflect new structure.
