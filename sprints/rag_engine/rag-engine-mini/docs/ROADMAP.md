# 🗺️ RAG Engineering Mastery Roadmap

> Your journey from "Hello World" to "AI Lead Engineer" within this project.

---

## 🟢 Level 1: Foundations (Stage 1)
*   **Concepts**: Vector Embeddings, Cosine Similarity, SQL metadata.
*   **Milestone**: Run `01_intro_and_setup.ipynb` and see your first RAG answer.
*   **Study**: [Clean Architecture for AI](./docs/deep-dives/clean-architecture-for-ai.md).

## 🟡 Level 2: Production Readiness (Stage 2)
*   **Concepts**: Background Task Queues, SSE Streaming, Parent-Child Chunking.
*   **Milestone**: Upload a large document while the UI remains responsive.
*   **Study**: [Scaling RAG Pipes](./docs/deep-dives/scaling-rag-pipelines.md).

## 🟠 Level 3: Advanced Intelligence (Stage 3)
*   **Concepts**: LLM-as-a-Judge, Self-Correction, Knowledge Graph Triplets.
*   **Milestone**: Ask a question that the system refuses to answer because it failed the "Relvancy Grader."
*   **Study**: [Self-Corrective RAG](./docs/deep-dives/stage-3-intelligence.md).

## 🔴 Level 4: Multi-Modal Mastery (Stage 4)
*   **Concepts**: Structural Table Analysis, Vision-to-Text descriptors.
*   **Milestone**: Search for a chart by its description even though the text isn't in the page.
*   **Study**: [Multi-Modal & Tables](./docs/deep-dives/stage-4-multimodal.md).

## 🔥 Level 5: Autonomous Operations (Stage 5)
*   **Concepts**: Semantic Routing, Web Search Fallback, PII Redaction.
*   **Milestone**: System handles "Hello" without database search and searches the web for live facts.
*   **Study**: [Autonomous Agent](./docs/deep-dives/stage-5-autonomy.md).

## 🚀 The Future (Final Boss and Beyond)
*   **Self-Improving Loops**: Automated fine-tuning based on user feedback.
*   **Multi-Agent Swarms**: LLMs that coordinate to solve massive research tasks.
*   **Privacy Layer**: Integrated Zero-Knowledge proofs for data.

> [!TIP]
> Don't rush. Spend time reading the **Vanilla Python** logic in `src/application/services` to understand how these systems work without library magic.
