## 🧠 Key Insights

### 1. The White-Box Approach
Rather than treating AI systems as black boxes, you've learned to understand and implement each component from the ground up. This approach builds deep intuition about how systems work and how to troubleshoot them effectively.

### 2. Architecture Matters
The right architecture doesn't just organize code—it enables rapid iteration, reliable operation, and effective scaling. Clean architecture patterns are especially crucial in AI systems where complexity can grow rapidly.

### 3. Balance Between Quality and Speed
Production systems must balance perfect accuracy with acceptable response times. The RAG Engine Mini demonstrates how to make these trade-offs explicit and configurable.

### 4. Evaluation is Critical
Without proper evaluation, there's no way to know if changes improve or degrade system performance. The evaluation tools in this system provide objective measures of quality.
