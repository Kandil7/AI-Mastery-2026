### A
*   **Adapter (محول)**: A structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
*   **Asynchronous (غير متزامن)**: Operations that run in the background without blocking the main program (e.g., Celery).

### C
*   **Chunking (التقطيع)**: The process of splitting a large document into smaller pieces for LLM processing.
*   **Clean Architecture (المعمارية النظيفة)**: A software design philosophy that isolates business logic from external dependencies.
*   **Context Window (نافذة السياق)**: The maximum number of tokens an LLM can "see" at once.
*   **Contextual Retrieval (الاسترجاع السياقي)**: Adding document summaries to chunks to keep the global context.
*   **Cross-Encoder (المشفر المتقاطع)**: A reranking model that compares query and chunk simultaneously for higher precision.

### D
*   **Dependency Injection (حقن التبعيات)**: A technique where objects receive their dependencies from an external source rather than creating them.

### E
*   **Embeddings (التمثيلات المتجهية)**: Numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.

### H
*   **Hallucination (هلوسة)**: When an LLM generates information that is factually incorrect or not in the context.
*   **Hybrid Search (البحث الهجين)**: Combining Semantic (Vector) and Lexical (Keyword) search for better results.

### K
*   **Knowledge Graph (رسم بياني للمعرفة)**: A structured representation of entities and their relationships.

### L
*   **LLM-as-a-Judge (النموذج كـ مقيم)**: Using one LLM to evaluate the performance or output of another LLM.

### P
*   **Port (منفذ)**: An interface (Protocol) that defines what a component should do without saying how.

### R
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Enhancing LLM answers by providing relevant external documents.
*   **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)**: An algorithm to merge ranked lists from different search engines.

### T
*   **Tenant (مستأجر)**: A single user or organization in a multi-tenant system.
*   **Token (رمز)**: The basic unit of text processed by an LLM (words or pieces of words).
